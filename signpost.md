# What is RupeeMUD?
RupeeMUD is a CoffeeMUD derrivative text-based adventure game inspired entirely by the world of the Legend of Zelda, in particular - this game focuses mainly on the elements present in the two Legend of Zelda titles for the Nintendo 64: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask. The world of RupeeMUD is a thriving representation of the world of Hyrule from that time period, we are being very careful to stay true to the original material while also converting and porting the concept over to a less visual medium and a completely different game concept.

RupeeMUD is basically like Ocarine of Time: Online, the same stories and adventures take place but they are on a much grander scale and are pushed forward by the heroes of hyrule themselves - but you don't have to be a hero! Hyrule is a thriving place, it's a working machine that needs money, resources and manpower to run and thusly, merchants and laborors are just as welcome in hyrule as any hero or villain. Concepts, skills, abilities and magics are all borrowed from either cannon Zelda titles or are already present in the universe,  for example we didn't want to exclude sailing, building, fitting and repairing ships in our world since ships are definately a part of Hyrulean lore.
